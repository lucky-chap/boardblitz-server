To help resolve the test error, please provide the following specific information:

1. Which test file is failing? (e.g., gameRouter.test.ts, userRouter.test.ts, etc.)
2. Which specific test case is failing? (e.g., "should return all users", "should handle errors", etc.)
3. What is the complete error message from the test output?
4. What changes have you already tried to fix this issue?
5. What is the expected behavior of the test?
6. What is the actual behavior you're seeing?
7. Are you seeing this error when running a single test or during the entire test suite?

The workspace contains several test files including:
- src/api/game/__tests__/gameRouter.test.ts
- src/api/user/__tests__/userRouter.test.ts
- src/common/__tests__/errorHandler.test.ts
- src/common/__tests__/requestLogger.test.ts

Please indicate which of these (or another test file) contains the failing test. Without this information, it's difficult to implement the correct fix.
